# Amitabh Bachchan AI Avatar – Internship Project @ UptoSkills

This project showcases an **AI-powered talking avatar** of legendary actor **Amitabh Bachchan**, developed as part of my internship at **UptoSkills**. The system combines **voice cloning** and **facial animation** technologies to generate a realistic video where the virtual Amitabh Bachchan delivers an educational message.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to explore **generative AI** capabilities in multimedia, by building a talking avatar from a single image and a script — simulating natural speech and facial expressions.

**Key Highlights:**
- Cloned the iconic voice of Amitabh Bachchan using advanced **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** models.
- Animated a static image with synchronized facial expressions using **SadTalker**.
- Rendered a complete educational video featuring lifelike speech and lip movement.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: A still image and a written script
2. **Voice Cloning**: Script is converted to audio using a cloned Amitabh Bachchan voice model
3. **Animation**: SadTalker generates lip movements based on the voice
4. **Output**: A fully synchronized talking avatar video
